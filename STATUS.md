- [x] **Scan Input** (`internal/tui/scan.go`)
  - URL input validation
  - User-friendly error messages
  - Auto-prefix with https:// if needed
  - Transition to scan progress

- [x] **Scan Progress** (`internal/tui/progress.go`)
  - Live progress bars and spinners
  - Real-time ETA calculation
  - Multi-step scanning simulation
  - Live log feed of operations
  - Completion detection and results transition

- [x] **Results Display** (`internal/tui/results.go`)
  - Tabbed interface (Overview, Vulnerabilities, Technologies, AI Analysis)
  - Interactive table for vulnerability data
  - Color-coded security scoring
  - Mock data for demonstration

- [x] **History Management** (`internal/tui/history.go`)
  - List view of previous scans
  - Sortable by date and security score
  - Quick navigation to detailed results
  - Mock historical data

- [x] **Settings** (`internal/tui/settings.go`)
  - API key management interface
  - Provider selection and configuration
  - Secure storage considerations

- [x] **Help Documentation** (`internal/tui/help.go`)
  - Comprehensive user guide
  - Feature explanations
  - Navigation shortcuts
  - Provider information

### Features Working
- [x] Full TUI navigation flow
- [x] Consistent styling and color schemes
- [x] Responsive design
- [x] Error handling and validation
- [x] Mock data for demonstration
- [x] Keyboard shortcuts and navigation
- [x] Seamless transitions between screens

### Quality Assurance
- [x] Application compiles without errors
- [x] All TUI models properly implement tea.Model interface
- [x] Consistent styling across all components
- [x] Navigation works in all directions
- [x] Error states handled gracefully

## ðŸš§ Phase 2: Scanning Engine - NOT STARTED

### Planned Implementation
- [ ] Port scanner with service detection
- [ ] Technology detection (headers, frameworks)
- [ ] SSL/TLS certificate analysis
- [ ] Security headers assessment
- [ ] Directory/file discovery
- [ ] DNS analysis and subdomain enumeration
- [ ] Integration with external APIs (Shodan, VirusTotal, etc.)

## ðŸ“‹ Phase 3: AI Integration - NOT STARTED

### Planned Implementation
- [ ] Multi-provider AI interface
- [ ] Secure API key management
- [ ] Prompt engineering for different analysis types
- [ ] Analysis result integration
- [ ] Educational content generation

## ðŸ“ˆ Phase 4: Advanced Features - NOT STARTED

### Planned Implementation
- [ ] PDF/DOCX export functionality
- [ ] Data persistence with LevelDB
- [ ] Report templates
- [ ] Performance optimizations

## ðŸŽ¯ Current State

The application is now at a fully functional Phase 1 state with:

1. **Complete TUI Framework**: All navigation screens implemented and working
2. **Professional UI**: Beautiful, consistent design with proper color coding
3. **Mock Data Flow**: Demonstrates complete user journey from scan to results
4. **Responsive Design**: Adapts to different terminal sizes
5. **Error Handling**: Proper validation and user feedback

## ðŸš€ Next Steps

1. **Begin Phase 2**: Implement actual scanning capabilities
2. **Start with Port Scanner**: Basic network reconnaissance
3. **Add Technology Detection**: HTTP headers and response analysis
4. **Implement SSL Analysis**: Certificate validation and security checks

## ðŸ“Š Metrics

- **Lines of Code**: ~1,500 lines
- **Files Created**: 12 files
- **Dependencies**: 10 main packages
- **Features**: 5 main TUI screens + navigation
- **Development Time**: Phase 1 complete

The foundation is solid and ready for Phase 2 implementation!
