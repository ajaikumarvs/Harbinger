# 🎯 Harbinger Project Status

## ✅ Completed Features

### 🏗️ Core Architecture
- [x] **Project Structure**: Modular Go architecture with clear separation of concerns
- [x] **CLI Framework**: Cobra-based command-line interface with subcommands
- [x] **Data Models**: Comprehensive data structures for scan results
- [x] **Configuration**: Viper-based configuration management

### 🔍 Scanning Capabilities
- [x] **HTTP Header Analysis**: 
  - Security header detection (HSTS, CSP, X-Frame-Options, etc.)
  - Missing header identification
  - Security grading system (A+ to F)
  - Detailed recommendations

- [x] **SSL/TLS Analysis**:
  - Certificate information extraction
  - Protocol version detection (TLS 1.0-1.3)
  - Cipher suite analysis
  - Vulnerability detection (weak algorithms, expired certs)
  - Security grading system

- [x] **URL Validation**: Proper URL parsing and scheme handling

### 🎨 User Interface
- [x] **Beautiful TUI**: Bubbletea-based terminal interface with:
  - Real-time progress bars
  - Color-coded results
  - Interactive navigation
  - Responsive design

- [x] **Direct Output Mode**: Clean, formatted output for CI/CD integration

### 🛠️ Developer Experience
- [x] **Modular Code**: Clean separation between scanning, UI, and CLI logic
- [x] **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error handling and user feedback
- [x] **Documentation**: README, development guide, and inline comments
- [x] **Configuration Examples**: Sample configuration file

## 🚀 Demonstrated Functionality

Successfully scanned and analyzed:
- **GitHub.com**: B- header grade, A+ SSL grade
- **Google.com**: F header grade (missing 6 headers), A+ SSL grade  
- **Example.com**: F header grade (HTTP only), no SSL

## 📊 Project Metrics

- **Go Files**: 10 (well-structured, ~1,500 lines total)
- **Packages**: 4 main packages (scanner, tui, models, cmd)
- **Dependencies**: 15+ external packages (Cobra, Bubbletea, Lipgloss, etc.)
- **Build Time**: ~2 seconds
- **Binary Size**: ~11MB (includes all dependencies)
